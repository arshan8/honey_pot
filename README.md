## What is a Honeypot?

A **honeypot** is a **decoy system or server** set up to attract cyber attackers and study their behavior. It pretends to be a real target (like a web server or database), but it's **isolated and monitored**. The goal is to **detect, deflect, or analyze attacks** without risking actual systems.

## Real-Life Use Case

A **bank** sets up a honeypot that looks like its internal customer database. When a hacker tries to access it, the system **logs the attack methods**, **IP addresses**, and **malware used**, helping the bank **improve its real security** and sometimes **trace the attacker**.
